    <h1>Pages that Amuse Me</h1>
    <h2>Fein</h2>
    <p>There's this video of a group of guys at a Travis Scott concert singing the song 'Fein', and the way they sing it is hilarious.</p>

    <h2>Wait I'm Goated</h2>
    <p>This page is a meme analysis of this meme that says, "Wait I'm Goated." There's usually a stupid picture of a cat that I just think is super hilarious.</p>

    <h2>Mulch Gang for Life</h2>
    <p>Here is another meme analysis of a specific breed of small dog with the caption "Mulch Gang." It's completely ridiculous and makes no sense, and I found it so funny last year.</p>
