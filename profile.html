      I'm a Graphic Design major in my senior year, and enjoy using and learning about computers and art! I've been drawing since I was a toddler, and editing videos and (barely) code since I was at least 8. I'm very hopeful for my future career in graphic design, and either want to go into UI/UX or branding- or both! I've been commissioned to create a website before, but only with using a website builder. I've created many graphic design projects for the UNC School of Art and Design. I'm currently a social media intern for the UNC Student Academic Success Office, and also manage the social media profile for the UNC Art Galleries!
